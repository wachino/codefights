## Description
------

At the beginning of this academic year you composed a list of clubs and a list of their members. The gathered information is stored in your local database in two tables that have the following structures:

* **clubs**
  * **id**: unique club id;
  * **name**: club name;
* **students**
  * **id**: unique student id;
  * **name**: student name;
  * **club_id**: id of the club the student joined.

Each student can be a member only of a single club, and it is prohibited to drop a club until the year is over. However, several clubs were closed due to low attendance, and you need to update your database to reflect that. You have already updated the **clubs** table, and now the **students** table should be updated as well.

Given the **clubs** and **students** tables, return a table containing the records from **students** that have <code>club_id</code> equal to some <code>id</code> of **clubs**. The table should be sorted by students' <code>id</code>s.


**Example**

For the following tables **students**

| id  | name                  | club_id |
| --- | --------------------- | ------- |
| 3   | Richard Gear          | 23      |
| 6   | Jennifer Offencerence | 11      |
| 14  | Obiten Kenobi         | 87      |
| 36  | Closece               | 87      |

and **clubs**

| id  | name         |
| --- | ------------ |
| 23  | Theater club |
| 64  | Soccer club  |
| 87  | Glee club    |

the output should be

| id  | name          | club_id |
| --- | ------------- | ------- |
| 3   | Richard Gear  | 23      |
| 14  | Obiten Kenobi | 87      |
| 36  | Closece       | 87      |
