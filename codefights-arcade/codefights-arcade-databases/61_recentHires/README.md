## Description
------

Your company has many different departments. Information about the employees working in these departments is stored in the **pr_department**, **it_department**, and **sales_department** tables, which have the following structures:

* **pr_department**:
  * id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
  * name: the name of the employee;
  * date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
* **it_department**:
  * id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
  * name: the name of the employee;
  * date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
* **sales_department**:
  * id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
  * name: the name of the employee;
  * date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.

Your task is to prepare a report that has the names of all the employees who were hired recently.

Given the **pr_department**, **it_department**, and **sales_department** tables, compose the result as follows: The resulting table should have one column <code>names</code> that contains the names of the last *five* people to join *each* department. The names of the employees from the **pr_department** should come first, followed by the **it_department**, and the **sales_department** will come last. The names of employees who work in the same department should be sorted in ascending order.

**Example**

For the following tables **pr_department**

| id  | name            | date_joined |
| --- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 2   | Bertha Neiman   | 2010-12-15  |
| 3   | Melissa Chace   | 2012-08-14  |
| 4   | Doyle Wiste     | 2015-01-02  |
| 8   | Libbie Troy     | 2016-03-04  |
| 15  | Noreen Bonner   | 2012-07-07  |
| 42  | Farah Dahlquist | 2006-12-12  |

**it_department**

| id  | name              | date_joined |
| --- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Farah Dahlquist   | 2017-01-15  |
| 2   | Mohammed Claycomb | 2016-06-11  |
| 3   | Allen Reger       | 2015-08-12  |
| 5   | Jacque Fuhr       | 2013-04-01  |

| 7   | Edmond Kind   | 2007-07-07  |

the output should be
